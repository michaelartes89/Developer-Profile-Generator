# Developer-Profile-Generator
This project is a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a Git Hub Username.

# Instruction 
To use this application, the user needs to optain an access token from GitHub to access the GitHub API. User will be prompter to enter token when the application runs. 

# Developer Story
This project is the first assignment of the backend developement portion of the JHU Fullstack bootcamp. This project involved using node.js to write javascript which runs in the terminal rather than in the browser. At this point I am personally more interested in frontend development but I definitly see the advantages of gaining additonal knowledge of the backend processes that are involved in the overall fied of development. 
## new concepts
Some new concepts I learned about in this project include:
Node.js
-fs
Modularization
-require
NPM
-package.json
-node_modules
Inquirer
ES6
let and const
template literals
Asychronous JavaScript
-callbacks
-promises
-async/await
-axios
## Takeaways
This project is a good example of how a relativley simple application can have powerful real world applicability, especially in a business context. I am looking forward to learning about backend development during the second half of the camp. 

## Acknowledgment
Major thanks to the bootcamp classmates for creating very supportive and colloborative environment. Making progress in learning these new concepts would not be possible without the support of everyone, especially my studygroup partners Tina and Keisha!
